           <h1>Impactful Video Games in My Life</h1>
           <p>Here I'm going to talk about a handful of video games that affected me personally as a kid and young adult. They're somewhat ordered by when I played them. They also aren't all necessarily life changing, masterpieces, or emotionally impactful (that's kind of difficult to quantify, but some of them are definitely very good). I will, however, discuss what they meant to me when I first played them, and how they've impacted my life to this day. Thanks for reading.</p>

                    <p>Watching my dad play Age of Empires II when I was around 6 or 7 really put a lasting impression on me. These historically inspired real-time strategy games feature civilizations from around the world in various time periods. Age of Empires II focused on the middle ages and renaissance, and Age of Mythology took a fantastical approach to early civilization around the iron and bronze ages. Each match, the player builds from a small settlement into a flourishing village with the aim to conquer their enemies. Gathering and managing resources, planning ahead, and commanding armies were all part of these influential games' experience. Though I did struggle with the more complicated strategy behind these games, playing on easy mode was typically a very satisfying experience. I loved to build cities and assemble armies. All of these qualities kept me playing these games for years to come.</p>

                    <p>Seeing and experiencing the games in this series gave me a familiarity with history and mythology that surprisingly transferred into social studies classes in school. Though the scenarios and games were purely fictional, the historical elements were there. For instance, it is not very likely Japan and the Inca ever engaged in melee skirmishes in the Black Forest, but it sure did inform a 6 year old Alex about the existence of the trebuchet. Names of influential figures, civilizations, technology, and locations fill my mind with real-world substance beyond what is typical of video games. I believe that playing these games so extensively gave me a love of trivia, language, and human culture.</p>

                    <h2>Pok&#233mon</h2>

                    <p>While not as impactful outside of playing the game, Pok&#233mon as a series has been a constant in my life since I was 8. Through 30 main series games and countless spinoffs, the Pok&#233mon adventure has been a similar concept: catching, training, and battling with hundreds of cute, cool, straight-up ugly, or just buckwild creatures.</p>

                    <p>Though there are 890 (and then some) Pok&#233mon to date, catching them all seems like a Herculean task, let alone remembering them all. My friends who also grew up with Pok&#233mon seem to have little trouble <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0592-8">remembering them</a>, but that's another story. Something so massive as this phenomenon really provides a means of connecting with people. Though we were apart in different places, we decided to come together over video call and rate every Pok&#233mon. It took a half a dozen multiple hour calls, but eventually we compiled a spreadsheet with our individual ratings along with averages and other statistics. It was fun the whole way through despite minor disagreements. I have a hard time thinking of anything that could bring us together to just talk and have an experience like that.</p>

                    <p>For me, Minecraft has been a creative outlet unlike anything else. The limits it creates with it's geometry and art direction is the perfect place to just start creating. Artist's block does not apply the same way for something of this nature. The rules and blocks provide a framework to begin building something structured. Because of this, it's not quite a blank canvas, and inspiration for building something is never too far away. It's these limits that make it such a powerful tool for art, creative storytelling, logic circuits, and so much more.</p>
                    
                    <p>Since I played it the first time nearly a decade ago, I've found myself revisiting it at least once a year, oftentimes with friends. The game is still being updated with new features.</p>
